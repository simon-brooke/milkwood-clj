 ears, conjures MRS ORGAN MORGAN And then Palestrina, SECOND VOICE he shouts to his deaf dog who smiles and licks his hands. UTAH WATKINS Gallop, you bleeding cripple! FIRST VOICE From where you are you can hear in Cockle Row in the spring, moonless night, Miss Price, in my pretty print housecoat, deft at the clothesline, natty as a jenny-wren, then pit-pat back to my egg in its cosy, my crisp toast-fingers, my home-made plum and butterpat.

### Bugs

Not so much a bug, but as I've written this all as pure recursive functions it's vulnerable to stack exhaustion exceptions. I've specified extended stack size in the project file, but that won't be sufficient for analysing large texts.
